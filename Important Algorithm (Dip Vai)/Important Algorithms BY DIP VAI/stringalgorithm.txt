1. Common subtring of some string
   (i) Using Distinct Delimeter and making bit.
   (ii) Using one (normally '#') Delimeter and taking index bit(| operation).
   (iii) Starting always from rool without using Delimeter and traverse and create (if necessary) nodes while traversing taking index bit(| operation).
   (iv) 2 pointer system in suffix array using one (normally '#').   

2.Finding cycling shift/similarity
  Just append both the same string to it's end.
  i.e s=s+s;
3. Right left should be kept in clone but frequency should be 0 in clone.
